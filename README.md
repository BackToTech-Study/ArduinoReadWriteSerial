# ArduinoReadWriteSerial
Read and Write the serial port in Arduino

## Preparation
- [x] [Insatlling the IDE (Integrated Development Environment)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)
- [x] Connect your board
- [x] Validate connection with blink

## Programming arduino
- [x] Code is written in a C like language. [Language reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)
- [x] Source code is saved in files with he extension .ino
- [x] the [setup](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/sketch/setup/) function
- [x] the [loop](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/sketch/loop/) function 
- [x] Tools -> Serial monitor
- [x] How to create a project [library](https://docs.arduino.cc/hacking/software/LibraryTutorial)

## Support functions
- [x] Open and configure serial port wtih [begin](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/begin/)
- [x] Write serial port with print and [println](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/println/)
- [x] Read serial port with [read](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/read/)
- [x] Implement sleep with [delay](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/time/delay/)

## Main menu
- [ ] Create array
- [ ] Add value to array
- [ ] Add value at position x
- [ ] Read array
- [ ] Read value from position x
- [ ] Read address of position x

## Side topics
- [x] Implement read serial timeout with [setTimeout](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/settimeout/)
